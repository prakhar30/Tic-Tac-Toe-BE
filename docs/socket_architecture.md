# WebSocket Architecture for Game Lobby Backend

## Overview of WebSockets
- WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection.
- Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSockets allow for persistent connections, making them ideal for real-time applications like games.

## System Architecture
- **Server**: Acts as a central hub for all WebSocket connections, managing connections, handling incoming messages, and broadcasting updates to clients.
- **Clients**: Each client (player) establishes a WebSocket connection to the server, sending and receiving messages through this connection.

## Server-Side Implementation
- **WebSocket Library**: Use a Go library like `gorilla/websocket` to handle WebSocket connections.
- **Connection Management**: Maintain a list of active connections for each game using a map where the key is the game ID and the value is a list of connections.
- **Message Handling**: Implement handlers for different types of messages (e.g., player moves, game state updates). The server processes these messages and updates the game state accordingly.
- **Broadcasting**: When a game state changes (e.g., a player makes a move), the server broadcasts the updated state to all connected clients for that game.

## Client-Side Implementation
- **Establish Connection**: When a player joins a game, the client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.
- **Send/Receive Messages**: The client sends messages to the server (e.g., player moves) and listens for messages from the server (e.g., game state updates).
- **Update UI**: Upon receiving a message from the server, the client updates the game UI to reflect the new state.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens to authenticate WebSocket connections. The client sends the token when establishing the connection, and the server validates it.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., spamming messages).

## Scalability Considerations
- **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer to distribute WebSocket connections across multiple server instances.
- **State Management**: Consider using a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to manage game state across multiple servers.

## Example Implementation Steps

1. **Setup WebSocket Endpoint**:
   - Create a new HTTP handler for WebSocket connections.
   - Upgrade HTTP connections to WebSockets using the `gorilla/websocket` library.

2. **Manage Connections**:
   - Store active connections in a map or similar data structure.
   - Implement functions to add, remove, and broadcast messages to connections.

3. **Handle Messages**:
   - Define message types and implement handlers for each type.
   - Update the game state based on incoming messages and broadcast changes.

4. **Broadcast Updates**:
   - When the game state changes, send the updated state to all connected clients.

## Conclusion

By following this architecture, you can implement a robust WebSocket system for your game lobby backend. This setup will allow for real-time communication between players and ensure that game state updates are efficiently propagated to all participants.
